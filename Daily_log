Here I will log what I do every day I work on this project ,along with question that have arisen.

I started with a canu script
I had to examine the genomesize which was done through:
zcat /proj/uppmax2025-3-3/Genome_Analysis/4_Zhou_2023/reads/chr3_clean_nanopore.fq.gz | awk 'NR % 4 == 2 {bases += length($0)} END {print bases}'
Total bases: 10024814876 =10Mbp
Sedan kom jag inte längre - hittar varken coverage eller genome size för chr3

I decided a precise value was not required, and took 191Mb/14 chromosomes = 13.6mb in the canu command. 
I started running the canu batch file at 17.33
