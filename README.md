# Genome_Analysis_Master_Course
Collection of the work for the master course "Genome Analysis", spring 2025. 

This project will be a recreation of the paper "Chromosome-level genome assembly of Niphotrichum japonicum provides new insights into heat stress responses in mosses" by Zhou et al. (2023). My goal is to assemble chromosome 3 and to examine which genes regulate the heat stress resilience in Niphotrichum japonicum. 

In the wiki, the project and my results are described in further detail. In this github directory, you will find my code and key result documents.
