The parts I will perform will be, in order, quality assessment, DNA assembly, quality assessment of the assembly, structural and functional annotation, 
and differential expression analysis.
If I manage, I will also perform extra analysis in form of assembly using a different software, and assembly evaluation with Merqury.

Week 15: Canu assembly, Quality control and trim of DNA Illumina (FASTQC), Quality assessment of DNA canu assembly (BUSCO and Quast).
Week 16: Polish using Illumina DNA (Pilon), Softmasking DNA (RepeatMasker), align RNA to DNA (STAR)
Week 17: Structural annotation (BRAKER2) and functional annotation (EggNOG).
Week 18: Differential expression (featureCounts).
Week 19: Spare time, if in phase start with extra analysis.
Week 20: Extra analysis.
Week 21: Finish up and polish github, turn in final github. 
Week 22: Presentation.
